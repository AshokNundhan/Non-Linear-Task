# Non-Linear-Task
A non-linear dataset in the context of machine learning or statistics refers to a dataset where the relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target) cannot be accurately modeled using a straight line (linear model). Instead, the data requires a non-linear function for better representation.
